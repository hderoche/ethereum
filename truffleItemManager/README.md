# Truffle project for Item tracking

I built this project using Truffle, React and Solidity.

The purpose of the smart contract is to create an ItemManager that will track an Item

The customers can pay to obtain it and they also need to pay for the delivery.

It aims to learn how to track a product by generating an address for each item created and to track it in the different step of payment.

The whole project was deployed on Truffle and used a local blockchain.
